# Description

A small project combining Web3 and Unity Network for Gameobjects into a WebGL game, this project has been made for the only purpose of learning.

## Run Locally
Just run it as host from the engine and run multiple clients in the browser, you need to connect your Metamask wallet on the Sepolia chain to join the game and if you approach another player you can transfer CST tokens with the key "T".


## Tech Stack

For this project i used:

**Unity Netcode for Gameobject** but i also used **[Websocket Transport](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/multiplayer-community-contributions/tree/main/Transports/com.community.netcode.transport.websocket)** to make it work in WebGL.

**Web3 Unity SDK** from **[ChainSafe Gaming](https://docs.gaming.chainsafe.io)** to interact with smart contracts.

**Unity 2022.3.15f1**
